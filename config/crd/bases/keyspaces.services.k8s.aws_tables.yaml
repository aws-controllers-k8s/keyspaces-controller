                  Amazon Keyspaces has two read/write capacity modes for processing reads and

                     * On-demand (default)

                     * Provisioned

                  The read/write capacity mode that you choose controls how you are charged
                  for read and write throughput and how table throughput capacity is managed.

                  Amazon Keyspaces encrypts and decrypts the table data at rest transparently
                  and integrates with Key Management Service for storing and managing the encryption
                  key. You can choose one of the following KMS keys (KMS keys):

                     * Amazon Web Services owned key - This is the default encryption type.
                     The key is owned by Amazon Keyspaces (no additional charge).

                     * Customer managed key - This key is stored in your account and is created,
                     owned, and managed by you. You have full control over the customer managed
                     key (KMS charges apply).
