                  UDT names must contain 48 characters or less, must begin with an alphabetic
                  character, and can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores.
                  Amazon Keyspaces converts upper case characters automatically into lower
                  case characters.

                  Alternatively, you can declare a UDT name in double quotes. When declaring
                  a UDT name inside double quotes, Amazon Keyspaces preserves upper casing
                  and allows special characters.

                  You can also use double quotes as part of the name when you create the UDT,
                  but you must escape each double quote character with an additional double
                  quote character.
